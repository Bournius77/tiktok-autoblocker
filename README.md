# TikTok AutoBlocker | MassBlock, Create & Share Custom BlockLists
**COMING SOON!!**: Instagram AutoBlocker & TikTok AutoBlocker Chrome Extension

TikTok AutoBlocker is a custom script that can be injected into your browser using a code injection browser addon (TamperMonkey is suggested) and is inspired by the modern movement to block celebrities and individuals on TikTok who are perceived as out-of-touch or not contributing positively to society. This script provides an easy way to build and manage a personal block list on TikTok, empowering users to curate their digital exposure, and create custom blocklists that can be shared within communities and with friends.

## What the Script Does

- **Add Users to Block List**: When visiting a TikTok user's profile, you can click a button to add that user to your block list.
- **Download Block List as TXT**: Easily download your block list at any time in a simple TXT format, making it easier to apply in different contexts or share.
- **AutoBlocker**: Uploading a Blocklist .txt file initiates the AutoBlocker, blocking every user in the list, automagically!

## Getting Started

   - For Safari, Microsoft Edge, and other browsers, search for "Tampermonkey" in your browser’s extension store.

### Installing the Script

Once Tampermonkey is installed, follow these steps to install the TikTok AutoBlocker script:

1. Open Tampermonkey in your browser and select “Create a new script”.
2. Copy the entire script from [tiktok-autoblocker/script.js](https://github.com/jimididit/tiktok-autoblocker/blob/main/script.js).
3. Paste the copied script into the new script window in Tampermonkey.
4. Save the script by pressing `Ctrl + S` or clicking File -> Save in the script editor.

### Usage

- **Add to Block List**: Navigate to any TikTok user's profile. Click the "Add to Block List" button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen to add them to your custom block list.
- **Download Block List**: Click the "Download Block List" button whenever you want to download your list. Share with friends, share online, share with the world!
